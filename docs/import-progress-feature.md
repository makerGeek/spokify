# Animated Import Progress Feature

## Overview

The search page now includes an entertaining animated progress system that shows users what's happening during song imports. Instead of a simple loading spinner, users now see animated badges that progress through different stages of the import process.

## Features

### Progress Stages

The import process now shows the following animated stages:

1. **Fetching...** üîç - Blue badge with search icon
2. **Listening...** üëÇ - Purple badge with ear icon  
3. **Transcribing...** üìù - Orange badge with file text icon
4. **Translating...** üåç - Green badge with globe icon
5. **Finishing...** üíø - Indigo badge with disc icon
6. **Saving...** üíæ - Teal badge with save icon
7. **Complete!** ‚ú® - Green badge with checkmark and sparkle

### Visual Enhancements

- **Animated Badges**: Each stage has its own color and icon with smooth transitions
- **Progress Bar**: Shows overall completion percentage with gradient colors
- **Shimmer Effect**: Animated shimmer overlay on the progress bar during processing
- **Glow Effect**: Special glow animation for "Saving" and "Complete" stages
- **Success Toast**: Celebration message when import completes successfully
- **Smooth Transitions**: All animations use CSS transitions for smooth movement

### Technical Implementation

#### State Management
- `importProgress`: Map tracking progress for each song being imported
- `ImportStage`: TypeScript type defining all possible stages
- `ImportProgress`: Interface with stage and timestamp

#### Animation System
- **CSS Animations**: Custom keyframes for pulse, slide-in, bounce, and glow effects
- **Progress Simulation**: Stages change every 5 seconds to simulate real processing
- **Visual Feedback**: Different colors and icons for each stage

#### User Experience
- **Non-blocking**: Users can continue browsing while imports are in progress
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of what's happening during the long import process
- **Entertainment**: Makes the 40-second wait time more engaging and informative

## Code Structure

### Main Components
- `SearchPage`: Main component with progress state management
- `renderProgressBadge()`: Renders animated badges with progress bar
- `simulateProgress()`: Manages stage transitions and timing

### CSS Classes

## Benefits

1. **User Engagement**: Makes the import process more entertaining
2. **Transparency**: Users understand what's happening during the long wait
3. **Professional Feel**: Polished animations give the app a more premium feel
4. **Reduced Frustration**: Users are less likely to think the app is frozen
5. **Brand Consistency**: Uses Spotify-inspired colors and design patterns
